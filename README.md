## General

### Notes:

Thanks for checking out the Task App! I did my best to stay in the allotted time but did enjoy the process to I spent a skosh longer than I initially anticipated. Here are the things I used to build the app:

-   Vue 3 CLI
-   Tailwind CSS
-   Firebase (for Task API)
-   Bambee Login API (as provided in requirements PDF)
-   Jest (for a few simple utility tests)
-   Prettier

### A few things I would have done if I had more time:

In the interest of staying as close to the recommended time as possible I wasn't able to get everything done that I would have hoped. Including (but not limited to):

-   Expanded testing (vue components, utils, integration, etc...). I'd shoot for 90%+.
-   More extensive accessibility and screen reader testing
-   Componentize button and link elements
-   Better UI and interactivity
-   Better mobile UX
-   Additional sorting methods for tasks (currently they're stored by due date)
